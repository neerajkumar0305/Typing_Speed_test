A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
All that glitters is not gold.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
Knowledge is power.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.
United we stand, divided we fall.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
